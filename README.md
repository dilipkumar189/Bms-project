I want to create a chat application for company website where any user type anything or hii, then he got some questions and when type option 1or 2 ... then get data or any other questions, like a professional company website, so now create a all the best prompt to feed bolt.new so we can create out application, use vite

Here’s a comprehensive prompt for creating a professional chat application using Vite and Bolt.new:

```javascript
// Import required dependencies
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import App from './App.vue';
import './assets/styles.css';

// Initialize the Vite app
createApp(App).mount('#app');
```

### Chatbot Prompt for Bolt.new

**Prompt Structure:**
1. **Greeting Trigger:**  
   - User types "Hi" or any message → Bot responds with:  
     "Hello! How can I assist you today? Choose an option below:  
     1. Product Information  
     2. Customer Support  
     3. Other Queries"

2. **Option Handling:**  
   - If user types "1":  
     Bot responds with: "Please specify the product you want information about."  
   - If user types "2":  
     Bot responds with: "What issue are you facing? Please describe briefly."  
   - If user types "3":  
     Bot responds with: "Feel free to ask any question, and I’ll do my best to help!"

3. **Fallback:**  
   - If user provides an invalid response:  
     Bot replies: "I didn’t quite understand that. Please choose a valid option (1, 2, or 3)."

4. **Dynamic Responses:**  
   - Based on user input, fetch relevant data from APIs or databases.

### Implementation Steps:
1. **Frontend Development:** Use Vue.js for UI with Vite as the build tool.
2. **Backend Development:** Create an API endpoint to handle user queries and responses.
3. **Integration:** Use WebSocket for real-time communication between frontend and backend.
4. **Styling:** Customize the chat widget to match your company branding.

This setup ensures a professional chat application tailored for your website while leveraging modern tools like Vite and Bolt.new!
